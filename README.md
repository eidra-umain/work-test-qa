# Hello!

Welcome to Umain's Test Automation Assignment! This document contains the following things:

- Intro to the Work Test
- Technical specifications
- Requirements

## Intro to the Work Test

Umain is working on setting up a new and exciting restaurant service: Munchies! For all your restaurant needs! We have a design and develop builds ready. Now we only need automation test coverage.

## Requirements

### Create test plan

- as we’re close to a big release, we will cover only critical paths, write some test cases to cover the most critical functionality

### Automation

- Build an automation test framework which runs cases you just created!
Would be a plus!
- Integrate reporting, we need to show test results to the managers!
Umain’s Tech Stack and YOU!

## Umain's Tech Stack and YOU!

At Umain, our main test automation stack is Appium, JavaScript and WDIO for mobile and Selenium for Web. For this Work Test, you can choose any tech stack you are comfortable with.

## What's included in this Repository

In this repository you'll find an Android, iOS, and web project, all about the same basic "munchies" app. The Android project is made with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin Multiplatform. The iOS project with SwiftUI and the web project with Next.js 

You can find a prebuild android apk in 
```
umain-qa-work-test/Android/androidApp/build/outputs/apk/debug/androidApp-debug.apk
```


## Design
You can find the [link to the design here](https://www.figma.com/file/263XJno7ii0uEaarJP9Ydw/Umain-Tech-Case?type=design&node-id=27%3A5682&mode=design&t=BPI3BgkmmHVtTdCb-1).
There are 2 pages in Figma, called App and Web. App is used for the mobile view. Web is used for the desktop view.
To get the right fonts, colors, sizes and more, please refer to the design in Figma. You should be able to get this info from the components and styles.

## All done?

:star: Awesome, great job! :star:
The next thing is that a Umain QA engineer will take a look at your project, code, testcases anything you might have done
Here are a few ways to get your project to us:

- You could share your repo (if public) so that we can clone and install locally
- You could ZIP your project and send it over
- Share it from a Cloud solution to Umain (e.g. Google Drive)
